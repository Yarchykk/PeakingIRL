**Goal:**
Create a prototype where instead of being a visual gag I can physically get up and see what is actually around the corner. 

Reference Inspo: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f0d4f95-15e7-4e87-b658-946f654c2d9f

How I plan on achieving this:
Engine: UE5
Plugin: nDisplay 
Hardware: 2 Projectors and a webcam
​
nDisplay is a virtual production plugin that allows for rendering the game environment to multiple screens/displays through a user defined configuration. 
In the CSGO clip, the streamer is recording himself through a camera, cutting out the background, and overlaying himself on top of the game footage. 
My goal is to have a projectors setup to stream the game footage behind me on a prop wall. In the camera view I will physically already be in front of the game footage. 
Using a second projector I will then display a separate view of what one would see if they were viewing from the side. 
Using this setup I can physically stand up and see what is around the corner.
